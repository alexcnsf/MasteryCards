IfPr (A)>0, then

Theorem
2.1.4 Law of total probability . Suppose that the events B1, . . . , B kform a partition of the

Pr (A)=k/summationdisplay

Proof Theevents B1∩A, B 2∩A, . . . , B k∩Awillformapartitionof A,asillustrated 
in Fig. 2.2. Hence, we can write 
A=(B 1∩A) ∪(B 2∩A) ∪. . . ∪(B k∩A).

Furthermore, since the kevents on the rightside ofthis equation are disjoint, 
Pr (A)=k/summationdisplay
j=1Pr (B j∩A).
Finally, if Pr (B j) > 0 for j=1, . . . , k , then Pr (B j∩A) =Pr (B j)Pr (A |Bj)and it 
follows that Eq.(2.1.4) holds.
Example 
2.1.9 Selecting Bolts . In Example 2.1.8, let B1be the event that the ﬁrst box (the one with 
60 long and 40 short bolts) is selected, let B2be the event that the second box (the 
one with 10 long and 20 short bolts) is selected, and let Abe the event that a long 
bolt is selected. Then 
Pr (A)=Pr (B 1)Pr (A |B1)+Pr (B 2)Pr (A |B2). 
Since a box is selected at random, we know that Pr (B 1)=Pr (B 2)=1/2. Fur- 
thermore, the probability of selecting a long bolt from the ﬁrst box is Pr (A |B1)=
60 /100=3/5, and the probability of selecting a long bolt from the second box is 
Pr (A |B2)=10 /30 =1/3. Hence, 
Pr (A)=1

Example 
2.1.11 Selecting Bolts . There is one box of bolts that contains some long and some short 
bolts. A manager is unable to open the box at present, so she asks her employees 
whatisthecompositionofthebox.Oneemployeesaysthatitcontains60longbolts 
and 40 short bolts. Another says that it contains 10 long bolts and 20 short bolts. 
Unabletoreconciletheseopinions,themanagerdecidesthateachoftheemployees

40 short bolts, and let B2be the event that the box contains 10 long and 20 short 
bolts.Theprobabilitythattheﬁrstboltselectedislongisnowcalculatedpreciselyas 
in Example 2.1.9. ◭
In Example 2.1.11, there is only one box of bolts, but we believe that it has one 
of two possible compositions. We let the events B1andB2determine the possible
compositions. This typeofsituation is very common in experiments. 
Example 
2.1.12 A Clinical Trial . Consideraclinicaltrialsuchasthestudyoftreatmentsfordepression 
in Example 2.1.4. As in many such trials, each patient has two possible outcomes, 
in this case relapse and no relapse. We shall refer to relapse as “failure” and no 
relapse as “success.” For now, we shall consider only patients in the imipramine 
treatmentgroup.Ifweknewtheeffectivenessofimipramine,thatis,theproportion 
pof successes among all patients who might receive the treatment, then we might 
modelthepatientsinourstudyashavingprobability pofsuccess.Unfortunately,we 
do not know pat the start of the trial. In analogy to the box of bolts with unknown 
composition in Example 2.1.11, we can imagine that the collection of all available

patients.Inparticular,weassumethattheproportionsofsuccessforthe11possible 
compositions are 0 ,1/10 , . . . , 9/10 ,1. (We shall be able to handle more realistic 
models for pin Chapter 3.) For example, if we knew that our patients were drawn 
from a collection with the proportion 3 /10 of successes, we would be comfortable 
saying that the patients in our sample each have success probability p=3/10. The

Now, let E1be the event that the ﬁrst patient in the imipramine group has a

The events B1, B 2, . . . , B 11 in Example 2.1.12 can be thought of in much the 
same way as the two events B1andB2that determine the mixture of long and short

Deﬁnition 2.1.3 is worded somewhat vaguely because it is intended to cover a 
wide varietyofcases. Hereis an explicitapplication to Example 2.1.12. 
Example 
2.1.13 A Clinical Trial . In Example 2.1.12, we could explicitly assume that there exists an 
inﬁnite sequence of patients who could be treated with imipramine even though 
we will observe only ﬁnitely many of them

. We could let the sample space consist 
of inﬁnite sequences of the two symbols SandFsuch as (S, S, F, S, F, F, F, . . .) .
Here Sin coordinate imeans that the ith patient is a success, and Fstands for
failure. So, the event E1in Example 2.1.12 is the event that the ﬁrst coordinate 
is S. The example sequence above is then in the event E1. To accommodate our 
interpretation of pas the proportion of successes, we can assume that, for every 
such sequence, the proportion of S’s among the ﬁrst ncoordinates gets close to one 
ofthenumbers0 ,1/10 , . . . , 9/10 ,1as nincreases.Inthisway, pisexplicitlythelimit

the limit is 2 /10, etc. Also, we observe only the ﬁrst 40 coordinates of the in ﬁnite 
sequence,butwestillbehaveasif pexistsandcouldbedeterminedifonlywecould

The Game of Craps 
We shall conclude this section by discussing a popular gambling game called craps. 
One version of this game is played as follows: A player rolls two dice, and the sum 
of the two numbers that appear is observed. If the sum on the ﬁrst roll is 7 or 11, 
the player wins the game immediately. If the sum on the ﬁrst roll is 2 ,3, or 12, the 
player loses the game immediately. If the sum on the ﬁrst roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, 
then the two dice are rolled again and again until the sum is either 7 or the original 
value. If the original value is obtained a second time before 7 is obtained, then the 
64 Chapter 2 ConditionalProbability 
player wins. If the sum 7 is obtained before the original value is obtained a second 
time, then the player loses. 
We shall now compute the probability Pr (W) , where Wis the event that the

For each ﬁrst roll i∈{4,5,6,8,9,10 }, Pr (W |Bi)is the probability that, in a 
sequence of dice rolls, the sum iwill be obtained before the sum 7 is obtained. As

Summary
The revised probability of an event Aafter learning that event B(with Pr (B) > 0) 
has occurred is the conditional probability of Agiven B, denoted by Pr (A |B) and
computed as Pr (A ∩B)/ Pr (B) . Often it is easy to assess a conditional probability, 
such as Pr (A |B) , directly. In such a case, we can use the multiplication rule for con- 
ditionalprobabilitiestocomputePr (A ∩B) =Pr (B) Pr (A |B) .Allprobabilityresults
