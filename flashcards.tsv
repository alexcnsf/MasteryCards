Conditional Probability	The updated probability of event A after learning that event B has occurred, calculated as Pr(A|B) = Pr(A ∩ B) / Pr(B), where Pr(A ∩ B) is the probability of the intersection of events A and B, and Pr(B) is the probability of event B given that it has occurred.
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event A given that event B has occurred, computed as the proportion of the total probability Pr(B) that is represented by Pr(A ∩ B), intuitively the proportion of B that is also part of A.
Defintion 2.1.1	A notation for conditional probability, read as the conditional probability of A given B, indicating the proportion of the total probability Pr(B) that is represented by Pr(A ∩ B).
Probability of winning lottery ticket	The probability of a lottery ticket winning, given that one of the numbers drawn is 15, calculated as Pr(A | B) = Pr(A ∩ B) / Pr(B) = 8.4 × 10 −6, which is five times larger than the prior probability Pr(A) = 1.68 × 10 −6.
Conditional probability for frequency interpretation	The proportion of repetitions in which both event A and event B occur, among those repetitions in which event B occurs, which is approximately equal to Pr(A | B) = Pr(A ∩ B) / Pr(B).
Rolling Dice	An example of determining the probability that the sum T of two numbers rolled is less than 8, given that the sum is odd, calculated as Pr(A | B) = Pr(A ∩ B) / Pr(B) = 1/3.
Recurrence	A relapse or re-occurrence of depression within a specified time frame, typically two to three years.
Clinical Trial	A study in which patients receive a treatment, including a placebo, to determine the effectiveness of the treatment in preventing recurrence of depression.
Relapse	A re-occurrence of depression in a patient who has previously experienced an episode of depression.
Imipramine	A treatment for depression, one of the three treatments studied in a clinical trial, along with lithium carbonate and a combination treatment.
Lithium Carbonate	A treatment for depression, one of the three treatments studied in a clinical trial, along with imipramine and a combination treatment.
Placebo	A treatment that is intended to be neither helpful nor harmful, used in a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of different treatments.
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event occurring, given that another event has occurred, used to analyze the probability of a patient having a relapse, given which treatment they received.
Unipolar	A classification of depression that indicates the absence of manic disorder.
Probability	A measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, used to analyze the probability of a patient having a relapse, given which treatment they received.
Dice Rolling	An experiment where two dice are rolled repeatedly to observe the sum of the numbers, used to calculate the probability of a specific sum being obtained.
