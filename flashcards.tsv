Conditional Probability	The updated probability of event A after we learn that event B has occurred, considering the new information that B has occurred. It is calculated as the probability of A and B occurring together, Pr (A ∩ B), divided by the probability of B, Pr (B), as long as Pr (B) > 0.
Conditional Probability (Definition)	The conditional probability of event A given that event B has occurred, denoted Pr (A |B), is calculated as Pr (A ∩ B) divided by Pr (B) if Pr (B) > 0.
Conditional Probability	The conditional probability Pr(A | B) is the proportion of occurrences of the event B that is also part of the event A, given that the event B has occurred.
Event B	The set of all possible outcomes, for instance {one of the numbers drawn is 15}, where Pr(B) represents the proportion of total probability that is represented by Pr(A ∩ B).
Event A	The set of all possible outcomes that include a specific condition, for instance your ticket is a winner, where Pr(A) is the proportion of total probability represented by Pr(A) and Pr(A ∩ B) is the proportion of probability represented by the intersection of events A and B.
Definition of Conditional Probability Pr(A | B)	Pr(A | B) = Pr(A ∩ B) / Pr(B), which is the proportion of repetitions in which the event B occurs and the event A also occurs.
Recurrence	The repeated occurrence of depression episodes, often within two to three years, in patients who have previously experienced an episode.
Clinical trial	A scientific experiment in which a controlled treatment or placebo is administered to patients or subjects to assess the efficacy and safety of the treatment.
Placebo	A treatment that is intended to have no therapeutic effect, used as a control group in clinical trials to compare with actual treatments.
Conditional probability	A probability calculation that takes into account the occurrence of one event and finds the probability of another event given that the first event has occurred.
