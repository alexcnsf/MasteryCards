What is the concept that refers to the events that are part of both event A and event B?	Image placeholder
What are the intersections of set A with events B1 to B5 in a partition of a proof?	Image placeholder
Conditional Probability	The updated probability of event A after learning that event B has occurred, calculated as the probability of the intersection of events A and B relative to the sample space of B, which represents the set of outcomes in B that also result in the occurrence of A.
Conditional Probability	A probability measure that represents the likelihood of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, denoted by Pr(A|B). It is calculated as the proportion of the total probability Pr(B) that is represented by the intersection of events A and B, Pr(A∩B).
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred, written as P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B).
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event A given that another event B has occurred, denoted as Pr(A|B), is the chance of A happening when B has already occurred.
Multiplication Rule for Conditional Probabilities	A rule that allows the calculation of the probability of two events occurring together by multiplying the probability of one event by the conditional probability of the other event given the first event has occurred.
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, written as Pr(A|B), which is equal to the product of conditional probabilities Pr(A|B)Pr(A|B)Pr(A|B)Pr(A|B) up to Pr(A|B), where each probability is conditional on the previous event.
Conditional Probability	Conditional probability is the probability of an event A given that another event B has occurred, denoted by Pr(A|B). It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which states that Pr(A) = Σ Pr(Bj) Pr(A|Bj) for a partition of the sample space S, where B1, ..., Bk are disjoint and non-overlapping events.
Law of Total Probability	The law of total probability is a theorem that states that the probability of an event A can be calculated by summing the product of the probability of each event B in a partition of the sample space and the conditional probability of event A given event B. It is expressed mathematically as Pr(A) = Σ Pr(Bj) Pr(A|Bj), where B1, ..., Bk are disjoint and non-overlapping events.
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred, denoted as Pr(A | B) and calculated as the probability of both events occurring divided by the probability of the given event.
Random Composition	The unknown distribution of properties or outcomes in a population or collection, which can be represented by a set of possible compositions or proportions.
Bayes' Theorem	A statistical theorem that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or assumptions, in this case, the proportion of successes among patients.
Augmented Experiment	An experiment can be augmented to include potential or hypothetical observations of additional information to help calculate probabilities, allowing for the inclusion of outcomes that determine desired quantities.
Conditional Probability	(not present in this chunk, as it is mentioned in the context of previous examples)
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred.
Conditional Probability	The revised probability of an event A after learning that event B (with Pr(B) > 0) has occurred, denoted by Pr(A | B), computed as Pr(A ∩ B) / Pr(B), which represents the probability of A given B.
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred, which is calculated by dividing the probability of the intersection of the two events by the probability of the other event.
Conditional Probability	The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. It is calculated as the probability of the intersection of the two events (A ∩ B) divided by the probability of the conditioning event (D).
Uniform Coin	A coin where the occurrence of heads or tails is equally likely, with a probability of 0.5 for each outcome. In the given problem, the presence of two fair coins and three coins with a head on each side introduces a non-uniform probability distribution for a randomly selected coin. However, the probability of getting a head is still higher than the probability of getting a tail.
